abstract = {Hash tables - which map "keys" onto "values" - are an essential building block in modern software systems. We believe a similar functionality would be equally valuable to large distributed systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a Content-Addressable Network (CAN) as a distributed infrastructure that provides hash table-like functionality on Internet-like scales. The CAN is scalable, fault-tolerant and completely self-organizing, and we demonstrate its scalability, robustness and low-latency properties through simulation.},

abstract="In this paper, we propose a new method to enhance the fault-tolerance of the Content Addressable Network (CAN), which is known as a typical pure P2P system based on the notion of Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The basic idea of the proposed method is to introduce a redundancy to the management of index information distributed over the nodes in the network, by allowing each index to be assigned to several nodes, which was restricted to be one in the original CAN system. To keep the consistency among several copies of indices, we propose an efficient synchronization scheme based on the notion of labels assigned to each copy in a distinct manner. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by simulation. The result of simulations indicates that the proposed scheme really enhances the fault-tolerance of the CAN system.",
